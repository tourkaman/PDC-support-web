Before starting with the applicaton, make sure you read the items in the checklist below:

   together with a copy of a valid identification. This can be ordered online from `Skatteverket <www.skatteverket.se>`_.

   Complete the application form and submit it.

.. seealso:: **Nationality: Why do we bother?**

If you are concerned with what we do with your nationality information or why was ask, we at PDC do not care what nationality you have. 
Unfortunately, some of the computer vendors and states where these computers are manufactured do care.
Therefore we have to restrict citizens of a small number of nationalities (there is a list which is updated now and then) 
access to whole or part of our facilities.

.. We should state what vendors ask.
.. We should state what those countries are!

Linking SUPR to PDC
-------------------

Most projects are now managed through SUPR, so all PDC accounts should be linked to a SUPR account.
If you applied for an PDC account outside of SUPR, your account might not be linked.
You should check if your SUPR and PDC accounts are linked and, if necessary, arrange for the accounts to be linked.

Check if your PDC account is linked to your SUPR account:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Log in to your SUPR account.
#. Check the **Centres** section where it says "You are currently linked at:". 
   If "PDC" is listed there (as shown in the screenshot below), then your PDC account is linked to your SUPR account, 
   and you do not have to do anything else.
#. If PDC is not listed there, then your PDC account is not linked to your SUPR account. Continue reading.

Link your SUPR account to your PDC account:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contact PDC support requesting that your PDC account be linked to your SUPR account. Include the following details in your email:

#. Your PDC username
#. E-mail address connected to your SUPR account

PDC Support will send you a confirmation email when your SUPR account has been linked to your PDC account.
When you receive the email, you can use the instructions above to verify that your SUPR account is now linked to your PDC account.
