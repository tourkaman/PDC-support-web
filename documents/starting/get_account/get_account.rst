(1) SUPR requests: The account will be enabled for all the clusters where you are part of a time allocation. Jump here.

(2) Course request: Class accounts are available for Swedish institutes giving courses in fields that utilize high-performance computing. Resources are made available to classes based on availability of resources and how well motivated the use of national computation resources is to the content of the course. Jump here.

(3) Industrial requests: TODO. Jump here.

.. note::

   **Linking your SUPR account and PDC account**: Many things are now managed through SUPR, so all PDC accounts should be linked to a SUPR account. In case you have an active PDC account that was not applied through SUPR, and would now like to link them, jump here.

If you are a course participant, use the PDC electronic form (only for courses)

In order to apply for a PDC account please have the following

    A scan of your passport, or international ID card (ID card with clearly stated nationality). You will be asked to upload this as part of the application process.
    Information on which postal address the password should be sent to. This should normally be a university address.
    Examine the computer rules for running at PDC. You will be asked to agree to these as part of the application process.
    Examine the PDC privacy statement. You will be asked to consent to having your personal data being processed as set out there.

What to do to apply a course

In order to apply for an account at PDC you need to fill in the electronic form.

    Users without a valid passport/international ID card can use a recent printout from Riksskatteverket stating their nationality (personbevis) together with a copy of a valid identification instead of the copy of the passport/international ID card. This can be ordered online from Skatteverket www.skatteverket.se. The purpose of the certificate can be selected as anything that states the nationality. For example "Studier" or "Anst√§llning".
